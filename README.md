# cq (Clojure Query)

Command-line Data Processor for JSON, EDN and other data formats.

The joy of Clojure's [threading macros](https://clojure.org/guides/threading_macros), but on the command line!

## Rationale

While there are a few similar tools out there, such as jq, jet and babashka, these all have one or more reasons making them less suitable for command-line data processing.

cq aims to:

- Not require learning yet another query language - it's just ~~data~~ Clojure!
- Give the user complete power for writing queries, with as few limitations as possible
- Provide various input and output formats out of the box
- Be opinionated, ship useful tools/libraries pre-bundled

## Features

- Comes with [Specter](https://github.com/redplanetlabs/specter) and [medley](https://github.com/weavejester/medley) for transforming nested data structures and utilities
- Various [reader macros](#reader-macros) that make writing queries easier
- [Threading macro redirection](#threading-macro-redirection) reduces need for parentheses
- Supports all elements of Clojure that are supported by [SCI](https://github.com/borkdude/sci)
- No startup lag thanks to GraalVM native-images

## Installation

1. Download the latest version for your OS from the [releases](https://github.com/markus-wa/cq/releases) page.
2. Rename binary to `cq`
3. `chmod +x cq`
4. Move into a location on `$PATH`

You should avoid `cq-jvm` if possible as these are not GraalVM native images and will be slow to start.

## Usage

```
$ cq --help
cq is a command-line data processor for JSON, YAML, EDN and other data formats that utilises Clojure as it's query language.

Usage: cq [options] QUERY

Options:
  -i, --in FORMAT                         yaml     Input format: csv, edn, json, lines, msgpack, text, yaml
  -o, --out FORMAT                        edn      Output format: csv, edn, json, lines, msgpack, text, yaml
  -p, --[no-]pretty                                Pretty print output - default is true
  -k, --key-fn FN                         keyword  Function used to transform keys - currently only supported for JSON and CSV
      --yaml-unsafe                                Enables unsafe mode in clj-yaml / SnakeYAML
      --[no]-yaml-keywords                         Turn map keys into keywords in clj-yaml - default is true
      --yaml-max-aliases-for-collections           Sets max aliases for collections in clj-yaml / SnakeYAML
      --yaml-allow-recursive-keys                  Allows recursive keys in clj-yaml / SnakeYAML
      --yaml-allow-duplicate-keys                  Allows duplicate keys in clj-yaml / SnakeYAML
      --yaml-flow-style STYLE             auto     Sets flow style in SnakeYAML
  -h, --help

```

By default `cq` uses [thread last (`->>`)](https://clojure.org/guides/threading_macros#thread-last) semantics.

```bash
$ echo '{"a": {"b": [1, 2, 3]}}' | cq ':a :b (map inc)'
(2 3 4)
```

Using `#|` you can use the current value as `.`.

```bash
$ curl -s 'https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/commits?per_page=5' | \
  cq 'first #| {:message (-> . :commit :message) :committer (-> . :commit :committer :name) :parents (->> . :parents (map :html_url))}'
{:message "Fix #2197 extended regex pattern example",
 :committer "William Langford",
 :parents
 ("https://github.com/stedolan/jq/commit/a17dd3248a666d01be75f6b16be37e80e20b0954")}
```

There's also a destructuring macro `#&` to make using `(let)` easier.

```bash
$ printf "http://example.com/some/path" | \
  cq -i text -- '-> (str/split #"/") #& ([protocol _ host] {:protocol protocol :host host})'
{:protocol "http:", :host "example.com"}
```

### Threading Macro Redirection

While things like [`->->><?as->cond->!`](https://github.com/randomcorp/thread-first-thread-last-backwards-question-mark-as-arrow-cond-arrow-bang) are pretty funny,
it can be pretty convenient to just redirect a threading macro when you're working on a simple terminal without paredit.

All threading operators will change the query after that point to their implementation until followed by any other threading operator (no need for parentheses).

Note that threading redirection is currently only supported on the top level, not in nested threading macros.

```bash
$ printf "http://example.com/some/path" | \
  cq -i text -- '-> str/upper-case (str/split #"/") ->> (map str/reverse)'
(":PTTH" "" "MOC.ELPMAXE" "EMOS" "HTAP")
```

Currently supported threading operators for redirection:

- `->` thread first
- `->>` thread last
- `some->` thread some
- `some->>` thread some last
- `as->` thread with var name

### Reader Macros

This table explains the different reader macros provided by `cq`.
`<f>` is the form passed in after the reader macro.

| Reader Macro | Description | Interpolates to | Example |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------- | ------- |
| `#\| <f>`  | Use the current value as `.` | `((fn [.] <f>))` | `#\| (< 5 . 10)` |
| `#map <f>` | Map elements of a seq | `(map (fn [.] <f>))` | `#map {:a (:a .) :first-child (-> . :children first)}` |
| `#& (<d> <f...>)` | Destructure into vars | `((fn [.] (let [<d> .] <f>)` | `#& ({:keys [a b c]} [a b c]})` |

## TODO

- [Transit](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-clj) support
- maybe [XML](https://github.com/tolitius/xml-in), [HTML](https://github.com/davidsantiago/hickory) & Parquet support
